  Young women with eating disorders (ED) are at risk of harm to their social,
  emotional, and physical development and overall quality of life. How they use
  social media to communicate about their ED is of growing interest. Much of the
  current literature examining ED and social media use and ED primarily deals
  with negative impacts of social media use for those suffering from ED, such as
  harmful body images or poor relationship with food, we consider the alternate
  possibility of social media as a coping mechanism for ED patients to
  self-express and gain emotional support from their peers. With the emerging
  accessibility and popularity of vlogging platforms, some ED patients
  transformed their roles from regular users to social media health influencers
  who share first-hand experiences and critical health information with others
  who follow them. We interviewed health influencers in ED recovery and analyzed
  their YouTube content in the past year to better understand the potential
  health benefits of vlogging and journaling on public platforms for ED patients
  and theorize the mechanism through which being a social media health
  influencer facilitates or impedes ED recovery based on interpretative
  phenomenological analysis of patients' own experiences.
