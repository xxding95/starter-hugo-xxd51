abstract: "The long-term goal of the main ESDM study in South Africa is to
  advance understanding of the efficacy of caregiver-delivered early autism
  interventions, coached by non-specialists, in lower-resourced settings. This
  pre-pilot study aims to: 1)Document adaptations made to a caregiver coaching
  approach, informed by ESDM principles and delivered by non-specialist
  providers in South Africa; 2) Examine non-specialist coaching fidelity; and 3)
  Examine the fidelity of caregiver implementation of ESDM across 12 weeks of
  intervention sessions."
